# Tempest

## Description
A tempest is a fierce, unnatural storm. It can appear in any season or in any weather, but is larger and more powerful in the depths of winter. It is drawn to the warmth of living beings, and seeks to douse that life as one would snuff out a candle.

A tempest’s true nature is a mystery. Is it intelligent, or just a force of nature? Those who survive an encounter sometimes report hearing hushed voices and seeing strange forms within the whirlwind. Some few tell tales of the eye of the storm, where the colds and wind abate, and where relief from certain death is offered—for a price.

## Anomaly
Old magic permeates the Ironlands. These forces sometimes manifest as an anomaly, which is an otherworldly feature of the terrain or environment. Some are the embodiment of ancient spirits, and have unknowable motivations. Others are forces of nature given cruel purpose.
