# Maelstrom

## Description
In coastal waters and cavern pools, these swirling vortexes of frigid water drag the unwary into their depths, stealing the breath from their lungs.

Maelstroms often manifest in places of great loss and tragedy, on the sites of shipwrecks or the watery graves of drowned travelers. The debris swept into the maelstrom’s heart batter armor and flesh. The voices of the maelstrom’s victims, ripped from their chests with their dying breaths, cry out from the turbulent water.
