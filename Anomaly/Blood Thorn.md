# Blood Thorn

## Description
A blood thorn is a malignant, carnivorous plant. It seizes its victims with long, creeping tendrils. Then, it leeches their life through hollow thorns, eventually bleeding them dry.

Blood thorns appear in woodland areas throughout the Ironlands. They are especially common in the Deep Wilds, where they often encircle elf villages. Some suspect they are cultivated by the elves, or share a symbiotic relationship with them.

## Anomaly
Old magic permeates the Ironlands. These forces sometimes manifest as an anomaly, which is an otherworldly feature of the terrain or environment. Some are the embodiment of ancient spirits, and have unknowable motivations. Others are forces of nature given cruel purpose.
