# Sodden

## Description
A sodden is the restless spirit of someone who drowned or was put to rest in water. They can appear in seas, rivers, lakes, ponds or marshes. It is said that their loneliness compels them to draw living victims into their watery lairs.

A sodden is not confined to its resting place. In fact, some believe that surviving an encounter with a sodden will leave you vulnerable around any body of water until the spirit finishes its work.

## Horror
Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.
