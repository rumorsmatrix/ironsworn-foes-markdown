# Blighthound

## Description
Blighthounds lurk on blood-soaked battlefields, on the outskirts of settlements destined for famine, or within the dark catacombs of ancient tombs. Drawn to the dead, and foretelling great doom, they are capable predators and grim messengers of death.

They appear as gaunt, emaciated hounds, often mistaken for starving animals at first glance. Their fiendish form reveals itself in blood-red eyes, sweeping horns, and skin the texture of charred and blistered wood.

## Horror
Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.
