# Chimera

## Description
A chimera is the corrupted form of animal flesh given unnatural life. Its body is a collection of various dead creatures, fused together into a twisted, massive entity which knows only pain and hunger. When a dozen blood-tinged eyes focus on you, when its gibbering mouths open at once to scream, your only hope is a quick death.

## Horror
Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.
