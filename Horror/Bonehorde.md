# Bonehorde

## Description
A bonehorde is a mass of moldering skeletal remains given unnatural life. They are spawned in old battlefields or tombs, but often range beyond those places to seek out new victims. At the heart of a horde, surrounded by layers of clattering bones, are the remains of the spiteful being who gives the horror its cruel intelligence.

Its form varies. In tight spaces, a bonehorde may appear as an amorphous mound or as a spider-like entity with long, skittering limbs. In the open, it can crudely mimic the shape of an animal or person. The bones constantly shift—snapping like dry twigs—to accommodate its environment, propel its movement, and lash out against its victims.

## Horror
Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.
