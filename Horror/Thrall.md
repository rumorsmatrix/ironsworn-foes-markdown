# Thrall

## Description
A thrall is a living person controlled by the will of a powerful undead spirit. The malignant presence can lie dormant for some time, feeding on the suffering of the host and subtly manipulating them to achieve its mysterious and often malevolent ends. Once the host is weakened, the spirit supplants their will entirely.

## Horror
Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.
