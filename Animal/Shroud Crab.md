# Shroud Crab

## Description
Shroud crabs threaten careless or unlucky Ironlanders along coasts and icereaches. They have long legs, a segmented tail, and large, serrated claws.

Their carapace changes color to perfectly match their environment, making them nearly invisible among rocks or ice. When potential prey strays near, a shroud crab uses its powerful legs to spring at its victim. Then, it wraps around them in a horrible embrace, stabbing and slashing with its claws and barbed tail.

Packs of shroud crabs are known to work in tandem to bring down large prey. Some report seeing mighty elk engulfed by these voracious creatures. On occasion, the body of a missing Ironlander is found with their flesh picked clean to the bones.

## Animal
Animals are the mundane creatures which dwell in the Ironlands. Some animals are native to these lands; others were also common in the Old World.

Most wild animals are skittish and do not pose a threat to humans. Those creatures have no rank, and can be attacked or interacted with using appropriate moves. For example, *Resupply* (page 63) can represent hunting for deer or small game.

A few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.
