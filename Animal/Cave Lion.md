# Cave Lion

## Description
Cave lions are sleek, powerful creatures who dwell primarily in the Hinterlands and Tempest Hills. They lair in caverns and other hidden places, emerging to hunt prey such as deer, boar, and rodents. They are typically solitary creatures, but have been seen working together to bring down larger quarry. Even a mammoth is no match for a determined pack of cave lions.

## Animal
Animals are the mundane creatures which dwell in the Ironlands. Some animals are native to these lands; others were also common in the Old World.

Most wild animals are skittish and do not pose a threat to humans. Those creatures have no rank, and can be attacked or interacted with using appropriate moves. For example, *Resupply* (page 63) can represent hunting for deer or small game.

A few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.
