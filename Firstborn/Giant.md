# Giant

## Description
Giants dwell in the Tempest Hills and Veiled Mountains. They live a nomadic life alone or in small family units, herding oxen, mountain goats, and sheep. In their own language they are called the jokul.

Many Ironlanders misinterpret their quiet nature for dullness, but giants are keenly intelligent and observant. They have a great respect for life, even for our kind, and will use trickery and negotiation to avoid a fight. When they are left without other options, an enraged giant is a devastating, relentless force.

## Firstborn
The firstborn lived here long before the humans landed on these shores. The humans, in their arrogance, named this peninsula the Ironlands and called themselves Ironlandersâ€”but the firstborn gave it names of their own in a time beyond the reach of memory.
