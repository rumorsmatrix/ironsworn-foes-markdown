# Broken

## Description
Another people sailed to the Ironlands from the Old World long before our kin settled here. Something happened. Something changed them.

 Whether it was the long struggle in a harsh land, the ravages of war, or the corruption of some dark force, they left their humanity behind and became what we call the broken. Now, they exist only to kill, to destroy.

We fear the broken for their savagery. But, more than this, we fear them as a dark portent of what we might one day become.

## Ironlander
Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can *Ask the Oracle*, or follow these guidelines:

  * A common citizen or brute is **troublesome**.

  * A trained warrior is **dangerous**.

  * A powerful or veteran warrior is **formidable**.
