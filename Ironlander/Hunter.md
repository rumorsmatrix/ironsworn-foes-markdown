# Hunter

## Description
Hunters face brutal weather, difficult terrain, dangerous animals, and worse. Many never return from their hunts. Others return, but are forever changed.

## Ironlander
Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can *Ask the Oracle*, or follow these guidelines:

  * A common citizen or brute is **troublesome**.

  * A trained warrior is **dangerous**.

  * A powerful or veteran warrior is **formidable**.
