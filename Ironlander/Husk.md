# Husk

## Description
A husk is what remains of an Ironlander whose body, mind, and soul are hollowed out by dark magic. In their unquenchable thirst for power, they use their own essence to power foul rituals. Bit by bit, they give themselves to this ruinous path. They abandon their kin. They forsake their former lives. Their physical form wastes away. Their mind is shattered.

In time, only the husk is left. They are a needful thing, tormented by the memory of all they have lost, but willing to lose even more in their quest for power.

A husk may make tempting offers of rituals or rarities, but be wary. Their bargains are always in their own favor. When they turn against you, a husk is a cunning foe. They weave dreadful spells, summon swarms of lesser creatures, and unleash a savagery inflamed by their anguish.

## Ironlander
Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.

This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can *Ask the Oracle*, or follow these guidelines:
