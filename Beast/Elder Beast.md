# Elder Beast

## Description
Elder beasts—wolves, bears and boars—are huge, monstrous versions of their common kin. They are primarily solitary creatures, though elder wolves have been known to lead a pack of common wolves. They are not aggressive, but are protective of their lands and the creatures within it. Some say they are avatars of the old gods and as long-lived as the oldest trees.
