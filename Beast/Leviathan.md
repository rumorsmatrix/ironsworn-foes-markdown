# Leviathan

## Description
These massive sea beasts lurk in the darkness of the deepest fjords and in the abyssal depths beyond the Barrier Islands. They sometimes surface to hunt within shallower waters. They will indiscriminately destroy any Ironlander craft which stray to close to their hunting grounds.

Watchful sailors might catch sight of a leviathan circling their boat, studying them, in the moments before it attacks. Their dagger-shaped head is as tough and destructive as any battering ram, able to shatter a ship in a single blow.

## Beast
Beasts are monstrous creatures of great size and power. They are natural beings—not supernatural entities—but were unknown in the Old World.

## Quest
A leviathan lurks off the coast, preying on fishing boats and trade ships. Among the dead is someone important to you. Who is it? You have vowed to send this beast back to the depths, but doing so will require a mythic weapon—The Abyssal Harpoon, an Old World artifact said to be carved from the bones of a long-dead sea god. Where is this weapon rumored to be held?
